1) this command takes the output of /etc and puts the stdout to one.txt and
   stderr to two.txt
   I noticed that one.txt had all files in etc/ and the errors were appended
   to two.txt.

2) The top 3 dates with the most number of Youtube channels created from the dataset is

     3) Channels created: 8 on Nov,21
     2) Channels created: 8 on Sep,2
     1) Channels created: 9 on May,12

   I used this command to find the top 3: "cut -d ',' -f 21,22 'Global YouTube Statistics.csv' | sort | uniq -c | sort | tail -n 3"
   cut -d ',' sets a comma as a delimiter, -f 21,22 applies the cut to sections 21 and 22, which are the month and year. I then sort the dataset which shows repeated lines. I then
   use uniq -c, which counts all duplicate lines, which shows how many channels were created on those dates. I then sort it, which shows the channels in lowest to greatest order,
   and I apply tail -n 3 which shows the bottom 3 dates, which are the dates with the most channels created.   
   
   Non-formatted output:
      8 Nov,21
      8 Sep,2
      9 May,12

3) Command: ps -u tylersp24

  Output:
  PID TTY          TIME CMD
  3491745 ?        00:00:06 systemd
  3491748 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
  3491754 ?        00:00:00 sshd
  3491755 pts/4    00:00:00 bash
  3538207 pts/4    00:00:00 ps


4) I noticed that a vi and another bash/sshd  process was added to the process list. The ID was 3539784
   Output: PID TTY          TIME CMD
3491745 ?        00:00:06 systemd
3491748 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
3491754 ?        00:00:00 sshd
3491755 pts/4    00:00:00 bash
3539654 ?        00:00:00 sshd
3539657 pts/34   00:00:00 bash
3539784 pts/34   00:00:00 vim
3539960 pts/4    00:00:00 ps


When I quit vi, I noticed that the vi process disappeared, but bash and sshd stayed int the list.
This is because I closed vi but not the terminal window, meaning bash and ssh was running,
which caused the duplicate bash and sshd processes to keep running.
   Output 2:
PID TTY          TIME CMD
3491745 ?        00:00:06 systemd
3491748 ?        00:00:00 (sd-pam)
3491754 ?        00:00:00 sshd
3491755 pts/4    00:00:00 bash
3539654 ?        00:00:00 sshd

5) init is the initial process when booting up a linux system. Init executes getty/sshd per terminal and sets up a login. It essentially initializes the system and services for the user.
   Process id: 3491745
   I used ps -u tylersp24 to find the init (systemd) PID.

6) ps aux lists all processes with the a, u, and x flags. It shows all processes (not just the terminals), in a user oriented format which shows who owns the processes, and processes not attached to terminal.
